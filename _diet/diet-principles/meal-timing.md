# Will eating before bed cause weight gain?

Eating before bed will not make you fat. The change in your weight is directly related to the relationship between the food you consume and the energy you burn throughout the day. As long as you’re taking in less than you’re burning, you will lose weight. This is regardless of when you eat.


# How important is breakfast?

Unless you wake up and train very soon upon waking, it’s strongly recommended that you eat within an hour of waking. The longer you wait, the longer your body spends in a catabolic state, meaning it’s breaking down muscle for energy. This is not ideal, regardless of your goal. If you do not feel hungry upon waking, consider a shake or smoothie, which will go down easier than whole foods.

# How important is it to eat at the times suggested?

The RP Diet Coach app provides recommended meal times. It’s no problem to deviate by +/- 30 minutes to accommodate your schedule, but to maximize energy, fullness, and muscle building, do your best to eat as close to the suggested times as you can.


# How soon after a workout should I eat?

You do not need to consume a protein shake 30 seconds after finishing your last set to make progress. Aim to get your post-workout meal in within 30 minutes of the time specified. Waiting longer past this point may start to slightly negatively impact your recovery and muscle building, so try to avoid delaying your post-workout meal beyond this for best results.


# What if I'm not hungry or I've missed a meal?

## I missed a meal, what should I do?

If you missed a certain meal, depending on when in the day this occurs, proceed as follows:

* **1 Meal Left:** If you missed meal #5 of a 6 meal plan, and it’s getting late, you can combine the last 2 meals into one.
* **2 - 3 Meals Left:** You should have ample time left to condense your timing to every 2 – 3 hours. If necessary, you can condense the last 2 meals into 1.
* **4+ Meals Left:** Eat as soon as able. You should have ample time left to condense your timing to every 2 – 3 hours.

## What if I'm not hungry? 

First, consider waiting an additional hour and reassessing your hunger. Once you surpass 5 hours since your last meal, it’s time to consider eating soon. If weight loss is your goal, enjoy this feeling, as it’s unlikely to last long as you move through your fat loss diet and more food is removed from your plan. Consider having a shake or smoothie as part of the meal.

For weight gain, consider a smoothie or calorie dense foods such as oats, rice, cheese, eggs, and dried fruit. This will allow you to eat less filling food, yet still take in the calories you need to meet your goal. Also for those on the muscle gain diet, eat TASTY foods and make your foods tasty with creative cooking and seasoning, which will help “spice up” your weight gain.
