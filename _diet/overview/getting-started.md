# What is your refund policy for the diet app?

Subscriptions purchased in iTunes or Google Play are subject to the policies those stores set. As web developers, we do not have access to billing and subscription information for the app stores. Users who subscribe via their app store (generally, directly through the app) will need to reach out to their app store to request a refund. 

For subscriptions purchased via Stripe, there is a 30 day money back guarantee. We can offer this as we have access to the subscriptions in this server and cancel and process refunds. To qualify for a refund, users must reach out to either [info@rpstrength.com](mailto:info@rpstrength.com) or [app.support@rpstrength.com](mailto:app.support@rpstrength.com) requesting a refund within the first 30 days of their subscription. Refunds requested outside of this timeframe are not guaranteed. 

# Is the RP Diet Coach App the right product for me?

The RP Diet coach app is an excellent app for most folks. However, there are usability and health exceptions. 

The app does require some basic knowledge of counting macros. If you do not know or wish to know how macros work, we recommend a simpler option.

# How the RP Diet Coach App different from other apps?

The RP Diet App builds you a plan exactly and only for your specific needs, schedule, and preferences. It’s the least generic diet plan that’s ever been sold.

The app tells you what macros to hit meal by meal, and give you exact weights of every selected food you have to eat to meet those macros. If you want to maximize your chances of success, eat only the foods listed in the plan, or very similar whole foods. If you’re going to eat foods not listed, please count them to within 5g per macro. So if a your plan says to consume a meal of 20g of protein, 35g of carbs and 10g of fat, and you consume foods with a total of 17g protein, 37g carbs, and 11g fat, you’re in the clear!

# Does the RP Diet Coach App support special diets?

Yes! Whether it is your preference, of a food allergy, this plan offers extensive flexibility. YOU get to choose all food sources (within their allotted portions) from our list of recommended foods, so you can be sure to steer clear of anything you need to.

We have the following food filters: You can filter the list of foods shown in the app by enabling one or more of the following filters to match your dietary preferences. Only foods that match all of the selected filters will be shown.

| Filter               | Description                                                                                                                                                           |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Dairy Free**        | Foods that don't contain and aren't derived from dairy.                                                                                                               |
| **Gluten Free**       | Foods that don't contain gluten. Low gluten foods aren't included.                                                                                                    |
| **Grain Free**        | Foods that don't contain grain. Pseudo-grains are still shown as some people can eat them while eating generally grain free, and the few that exist are easily ignored.  |
| **Low FODMAP**        | Foods that contain low levels of FODMAPs (Fermentable Oligo-, Di-, Mono-saccharides And Polyols). If only a small and carefully measured amount of a food would be allowed then we err on the side of caution and leave it out.  |
| **Ovo-Lacto Vegetarian** | Vegetarian foods including milk and eggs.                                                                                                                             |
| **Paleo**             | Foods that are included on the Paleo diet. Opinions on what is "paleo" or not vary, we've done our best!                                                               |
| **Vegan**             | Foods that are included in a vegan diet. Since some people apply a standard of animal harm rather than excluding all animal derived products, we err on the side of including these easily ignored foods to make things easier for those vegans who do want to eat these foods. |

## I have a food allergy(ies). Can RP still work for me? Of course!

This plan offers extensive flexibility. YOU get to choose all food sources (within their allotted portions) from our list of recommended foods, so you can be sure to steer clear of anything you need to.

# What equipment will I need to succeed?

1. **A food scale.** Nothing fancy; just a scale that weighs food to the nearest gram. Check out some of [these basic food scales](https://www.amazon.com/Best-Sellers-Kitchen-Dining-Digital-Scales/zgbs/kitchen/678508011){:target="&lowbar;blank"}.

1. **A bathroom scale.** Again, nothing fancy, just a digital scale that will let you weight yourself so that you can tell the app what you weigh and it can adjust your diet from there. Check out some of [these basic bathroom scales](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=bathroom+scale&i=garden&ref=nb_sb_noss_2){:target="&lowbar;blank"}.

1. **Access to training equipment.** We highly recommend you train at a commercial gym, as the equipment there will allow you to get your best results in fat loss and muscle retention or gain. If you train at a non-commercial gym, like a box, or even in your own home, that's just fine. Can you use this app without training at all? Yes, but results will be highly limited.

# Creating an app account and signing in

The RP Diet Coach App allows users to sign in via multiple methods. 

We recommend that once you choose your method of log-in, that you sign in with that method every time. Otherwise, there is a risk of creating multiple accounts.

_Note: [Sign in with Apple](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102379){:target="&lowbar;blank"} is only available to iPhone users._

Otherwise, you can choose to sign up and sign in using your existing Facebook or Google Accounts.

# Will this app work for me if I am not training?

Absolutely. If you or members of your friend or family circle do not plan on training right now, we recommend our [Simple Diet Templates](https://renaissanceperiodization.com/shop/healthy-diet-templates/){:target="&lowbar;blank"} for a balanced eating lifestyle, including a lower carb option for those who prefer it. They can still use the app if they’d like, but the templates might be a bit simpler for those who don’t train and just want and eating guide for general health.

# What kind of training does RP recommend for various diet phases to give me the best results?

You don't HAVE to do any kind of training, but the more you train, the more muscle you'll put on or keep on, the healthier you will be, and the better your shape will be. Any kind of training works, but at least 2-3 sessions of weight training per week are recommended for best results.

If you’re dieting to lose fat OR gain muscle, high volume physique training is the best approach for either losing fat without losing muscle, or adding muscle without too much fat. If you’re doing sport training during these phases, backing off on that training a bit and adding a bit more physique training (plenty of sets and reps so long as you can recover) might be a good idea. If you’d like some guidance on this kind of training, look no further than the male and female physique templates:

  * [RP Male Physique Template](https://renaissanceperiodization.com/male-physique-training-templates){:target="&lowbar;blank"}
  * [RP Female Physique Template](https://renaissanceperiodization.com/female-physique-training-templates){:target="&lowbar;blank"}
  * [Simple Training Template](https://rpstrength.com/products/simple-training-templates){:target="&lowbar;blank"}

If you’re in a maintenance phase, the kind of training you do is up to you, but, if you’d like guidance on weightlifting or powerlifting training, we’ve got apps than can help:

* [RP Weightlifting Strength Template](https://renaissanceperiodization.com/wl-strength-templates){:target="&lowbar;blank"}
* [RP Powerlifting Strength Training Template](https://renaissanceperiodization.com/pl-strength-templates){:target="&lowbar;blank"}

If you’re still a bit confused on matching your training to your diet, please check out this [short video by Dr. Mike Israetel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifNJ0pZpmx0){:target="&lowbar;blank"}.

## Would the RP diet benefit someone who’s NOT training?

Absolutely. If you or members of your friend or family circle do not plan on training right now, we recommend our [Healthy Diet Templates](https://renaissanceperiodization.com/shop/healthy-diet-templates/){:target="&lowbar;blank"} for a balanced eating lifestyle, including a lower carb option for those who prefer it. They can still use the app if they’d like, but the templates might be a bit simpler for those who don’t train and just want and eating guide for general health.

# How does the app keep me safe while dieting?

The app will take into account your body, sleep schedule, workout schedule, and daily activity levels, and diet goals to create a personalized diet plan. As you weigh in over the course of your diet the app will recommend weekly nutrient adjustments based on your progress.

Daily macro targets are provided based on your schedule for that day which are broken down into specifically timed meals with individual macro targets. Our program is designed for consistency instead of perfection so the goal is only to be within 5g of any given macro and everything in the app takes this in to account.

## Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE)

To calculate your personalized safe caloric limits, the app calculates a Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE) for your specific body information and schedule. All increases or decreased to your nutrients are anchored around this calculation of how much energy your body needs to maintain the same weight and function at its best. In order to lose weight you have to eat less than your TDEE and in order to gain weight you have to eat more than your TDEE.

Our TDEE calculation starts from your Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR), which is the amount of energy per day that you'd need if you were asleep the entire day. It then takes into account the duration and intensity of your workouts and your basic activity level for the day in the form of an Activity Factor (AF) along with your age in years (A), your height in centimeters (H), and your weight in kilograms (W).

<img src="https://rp-apps-public.s3.amazonaws.com/tdee.png" />

## Diet goal restrictions

We limit the maximum allowed length of all fat loss and muscle gain diets to 16 weeks or less.

We limit the maximum allowed weekly weight loss rate to 1% of body weight per week to be well within safe bounds (e.g. Our heaviest allowed user (158.7kg) is limited to 1.6kg / week, while the literature allows up to 2.5kg / week)


**BMI limits**
The app does not allow users to use the app to continue losing weight if their BMI drops below 17. A BMI of 17 is categorized by the WHO as "mild thinness" and does not predict ill health except for extenuating circumstances.


**Minimum safe macros**
Calorie decreases come from fat and carbs never protein. Fats will never be dropped below 15% of your daily calories. Every meal will always have at least 5 grams of fat and 5 grams of carbs. If your diet ever reaches the point where you'd need to drop below those numbers you'll no longer be able to decrease nutrients and the app will recommend paths forward to raise your caloric intake before losing more weight.

## Is it possible to run a fat loss diet for too long or run too many fat loss diets back to back?

It absolutely is, and RP's Dr Melissa Davis has some [valuable insight on the subject](https://renaissanceperiodization.com/chronic-dieting/){:target="&lowbar;blank"}. We STRONGLY recommend never running two fat loss diets back to back without at least a 2/3 length maintenance period between them. (Maintenance should be at least 2/3 as long as the fat loss diet that preceded it.)
