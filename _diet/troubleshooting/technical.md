# I logged into my account, and all of my diet information is completely gone!

We have had reports that diets are completely gone after a user logs out and logs back into the app. 

We have found that in all of such cases, users have multiple app accounts, therefore when they log into the account that doesn't have the appropriate diet, it will appear as empty. In cases that this happens, we recommend trying to log in with a different email address, or contact support at [app.support@rpstrength.com](mailto:app.support@rpstrength.com) and we can locate your account.
