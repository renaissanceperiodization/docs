On iOS, the RP Diet Coach App already allows you to automatically import weight from Apple Health, say, if you have a smart scale that logs to Apple Health or you're already logging your weight in another app.

A new feature in the beta is also getting your steps data from Apple Health, which can be especially useful if you have an Apple Watch as your primary step tracker.

If you enable getting steps from Apple Health, you'll notice that at the top of your day's schedule, the "Step Count Target" card will also display how many steps you've taken.

This figure does not power the RP algorithm in any way--it is purely information for you, to know how you're doing relative to your target. The RP algorithm will always only use your committed-to step count target to determine allocation and scaling of calories and macros, so it basically assumes that you're as active as you say you're going to be.

If you see that you're likely going to significantly under- or over-perform on steps, you can change your target to get an updated calorie recommendation for the day, which will be reflected in calories deducted or added to your [Day Balance](/docs/diet-coach-app/1.22-beta/features/day-balance/).
