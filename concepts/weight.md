The RP Diet Coach app now recommends daily weigh-ins. During setup, you will specify what time of day you plan to weigh in (which will be the same time every day), but you can always change that by going to the "Me" tab → "Settings" → "Weigh Ins" → "Weigh In Time".

In order for the app to be able to recommend any change in calories from one week to the next, you must log your weight on at least 4 different days during the week. Otherwise, during Weekly Planning, the RP algorithm will recommend the same target average daily calories that it did the previous week.
